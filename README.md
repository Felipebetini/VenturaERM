## Introduction
Welcome, this is a resume of the project I worked on as a Front-End Web Developer and Cyber Investigator. This project spanned a duration of 1 year and 1 month. The aim of this project was to design and develop websites and web applications, while also actively participating in cyber investigation and forensics.

## Company Background
To better understand the context of my work, please visit [VenturaERM.com](https://venturaerm.com/), the website of VenturaERM, the company I worked for during this project. VenturaERM specializes in providing comprehensive cybersecurity solutions and risk management services to organizations.

## Cyber Investigation and Forensics
As a Cyber Investigator and Forensics expert, I utilized various tools and technologies, including:

- FTK Imager: Leveraged FTK Imager for forensic acquisition and analysis of digital evidence.
- Maltego: Utilized Maltego for open-source intelligence gathering and visualization.
- Linux: Proficient in Linux-based systems for conducting investigations and analyzing security incidents.
- Firewall Logs and SIEMs: Analyzed firewall logs and leveraged Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to detect and investigate potential threats.
- RAM Forensics Tools (Volatility): Employed Volatility, a RAM forensics tool, to extract valuable information and investigate memory-based attacks.
- iOS, Linux, and Windows Architecture: Deep understanding of these operating systems' architecture to conduct thorough investigations and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Ransomware Behavior: Analyzed and studied ransomware behavior to develop effective mitigation strategies.
- Sleuthkit and Sharkwire: Utilized Sleuthkit and Sharkwire tools for file system analysis and network forensics, respectively.
- Burp Suite: Employed Burp Suite for web application security testing and analysis.

## Front-End Web Development
In my role as a Front-End Web Developer, I utilized the following technologies:

- Vue.js: Leveraged Vue.js, a JavaScript framework, to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Tailwind: Implemented Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create consistent and efficient styling across the project.
- AWS and Nginx: Utilized AWS services and Nginx as a web server to deploy and host web applications.
- Docker: Employed Docker for containerization, enabling efficient deployment and scalability.
- AWS CloudFormation: Utilized AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure provisioning and management.
- PM2: Utilized PM2 as a process manager for Node.js applications.
- PHP and React: Worked with PHP and React to develop robust and interactive web applications.
- cPanel: Utilized cPanel for website management and hosting configuration.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Utilized these core web technologies to build and enhance user interfaces.
- Django and Python: Utilized Django, a Python web framework, for efficient backend development.

## CloudSleuth Tool Development
As part of the project, I also contributed to the development of a tool called CloudSleuth. This tool was designed to sweep the AWS cloud environment, searching for potential risks such as unusual password changes, user creation or deletion, and other suspicious behaviors. CloudSleuth played a crucial role in forensic analysis, enabling the identification and investigation of potential security incidents within AWS environments.

The combination of my front-end web development skills, involvement in cyber investigation and forensics, and contribution to the development of CloudSleuth allowed me to deliver comprehensive and secure web solutions for our clients.
